High-Frequency Market Data Validation & Cleaning Pipeline | Python, Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit
Developed an automated pipeline for validating and cleaning noisy high-frequency market tick data, producing research-ready datasets for quantitative trading.
• Performed in-depth profiling and anomaly detection on large-scale datasets (1M+ rows) using Pandas and NumPy, identifying outliers, missing values, duplicates, and timestamp gaps; reduced simulated error rates by 95% through robust cleaning (interpolation, deduplication, edge-case handling).
• Built modular, production-quality code with comprehensive audit logging, unit tests, and detailed issue reporting to ensure traceability and high accuracy in data workflows.
• Created an interactive Streamlit web application for ad-hoc data upload, real-time profiling, customizable validation thresholds, before/after visualizations, and cleaned dataset export—enabling efficient exploratory support for quantitative researchers.
